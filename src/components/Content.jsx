        Lee & Rick&apos;s opened in 1950, as a 9 stool establishment which only
        served oysters. Lee & Rick ran the restaurant out front, and raised
        their family in the back portion, which served as their home. Beverages
        consisted of whatever you brought in to drink, which Lee kept cold for
        you in her ice box. Today Lee & Rick&apos;s is operated by their oldest
        son and his family, continuing the tradition of this family run
        establishment. Vital to Lee & Rick&apos;s longevity is friendly
        personalized service, quality of food and maintaining the reputation as
        a local favorite. Today, the famous concrete shucking bar totals 80 feet
        in length, seating up to 50 people is a spectacle of delight as oysters
        are individually shucked for your entertainment, as well as an assurance
        of their freshness. Lee & Rick&apos;s was the first restaurant of
        it&apos;s kind to be opened in Central Florida. Rick, being a sailor had
        seen Oyster Bars in his travels around the coast of Florida and
        especially in the Panhandle where he himself had shucked oysters as a
        child. The restaurant was an instant success and just through word of
        mouth, quickly became known as &quot;the only place&quot;, for fresh
        oysters. Rick found himself making weekly trips to Apalachicola in his
        pickup truck just to supply oysters for his thriving restaurant.
